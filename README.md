# Aegis Command

## Overview
Aegis Command is an AI-driven mission intelligence system designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize soldier performance in real-time. It predicts risks, enhances squad readiness, and automates decision-making, helping military teams maintain operational efficiency and ensure personnel safety.

By integrating the Terra API for real-time health monitoring, AI-powered analytics for performance evaluation, and Zoom for instant communication, Aegis Command functions as a proactive command center that delivers actionable intelligence.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Health & Performance Tracking
- Monitors heart rate, fatigue, hydration, and readiness using the Terra API.
- Dynamically groups soldiers into squads based on live performance metrics.
- Alerts commanders to potential health risks before they become critical.

### AI-Powered Tactical Insights
- Uses machine learning to analyze past mission data and predict exhaustion, injuries, or performance drops.
- Provides real-time tactical recommendations based on squad readiness.
- Automatically alerts medical teams if critical health conditions are detected.

### Secure Communication & Command Execution
- Zoom integration enables real-time communication between squads and commanders.
- AI-driven chat interface (powered by Perplexity API) allows instant data retrieval and decision support.

### Interactive Command Dashboard
- Built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel v0 for efficient development and deployment.
- Fully responsive UI with intuitive charts, squad overviews, and AI alerts.
- Live mission updates through WebSocket integration.
